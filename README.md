# Memory Card Game

Select two cards and match them.
If they are not matched, cards will close and you can select another card.

### Scoring
If you successfully matched 2 cards on the first try, you score 10 points.
If you successfully match 2 cards on the second try, you score 9 points, and so on...
So make sure to memorize the card placement to get higher score.

### Local Storage
High scores are located on your localStorage so that it can track your latest highest score.

ENJOY!!!
